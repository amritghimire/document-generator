Aliquots of purified protein go into pre-barcoded tubes. The biomass itself will be placed into 50ml Falcons. The user will be able to print barcodes for the Falcons. </li> <li>After the large-scale purification has completed, the purified protein is then completely aliquoted and placed into storage at a central location.
